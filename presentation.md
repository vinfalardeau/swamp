# Swamps

Swamps are inland, freshwater wetlands that are predominantly forested or covered with lower-growing shrub plants.

##### Problems

- In some places, areas that were swamp prior to European settlement may have been cleared and converted to crops or hayfields. Between 1942 and 2012, however, the Middlebury Swamp appears to have seen some regrowth, as shown in these aerial images:

- Parts of the swamp have less trees, and lower biomass. These could be old agricultural lands or forest areas that have been flooded out, whether naturally or due to changes in hydrology introduced by ditches, berms, or other alterations.

- In these maps, we can see that the flow direction in the Middlebury Swamp changed over time. In 1870, water flowed north to meet Otter Creek, whereas in 2021 some straight-line ditches still drain north, but most of the swamp drains south and east before meeting ditches near the railroad that drain into the creek.

##### Goals

- Conservation should aim to preserve existing large blocks of swamp, especially in areas with greater diversity and rarer soils, species, or natural community types.

- Restoration of degraded and converted swamps should also be a priority.

##### Present Conditions
![Swamp Current Conditions Map](imgs/result.png)
- Most of the swamp in this test region remains forested.

- Some areas near Otter Creek have been converted to agriculture.

- Swaths south of Morse Road are occupied by grassland or shrubland, drained into the creek by artificial ditches. *layer ditches over this*

&ensp;


##### Conservation System

![Protected Status](imgs2/protected.png)

- A majority of swamp-soil area is not protected, as shown in this map.

- East of Otter Creek, there are larger conserved areas, some of them protected under agriculture. However, coverage is less than ideal.

*(have another look at parcel map)*

![Chart](imgs2/benchmark.png)

- Compared to a 70% conservation goal, swamp forest and shrubland swamps are falling short. Meanwhile, agricultural areas on swamp soils are well protected.

> Real benchmark should be of swamp soils, not just tree (70/50/30)

&ensp;

##### An Alternative Model
![Alternative Model](imgs2/habripmap2.png)
- If we instead took habitat blocks and riparian corridors as the basis for conservation, most areas of swamp soil would fall within one or both. There are only isolated pockets falling outside of riparian corridors or outside both.

- Areas of grassland/shrubland swamp and areas converted to agriculture tend to fall within riparian zones, but outside habitat blocks. Swamp forest is almost all within both riparian corridors and habitat blocks.

##### Protecting and Restoring Swamp Forest

> take out the not protected

- Protection of swamp forest would become nearly universal under the alternative system.

- Most shrubland swamp is not currently protected, but falls within riparian corridors or habitat blocks, and could be targeted for restoration to a healthy forest state.
