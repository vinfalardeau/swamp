# Swamps

Swamps are inland, freshwater wetlands that are predominantly forested or covered with lower-growing shrub plants.

##### Problems

- In some places, areas that were swamp prior to European settlement may have been cleared and converted to crops or hayfields. Between 1942 and 2012, however, the Middlebury Swamp appears to have seen some regrowth, as shown in these aerial images:

- Parts of the swamp have less trees, and lower biomass. These could be old agricultural lands or forest areas that have been flooded out, whether naturally or due to changes in hydrology introduced by ditches, berms, or other alterations.

- In these maps, we can see that the flow direction in the Middlebury Swamp changed over time. In 1870, water flowed north to meet Otter Creek, whereas in 2021 some straight-line ditches still drain north, but most of the swamp drains south and east before meeting ditches near the railroad that drain into the creek.

##### Goals

- Conservation should aim to preserve existing large blocks of swamp, especially in areas with greater diversity and rarer soils, species, or natural community types.

- Restoration of degraded and converted swamps should also be a priority.

##### Present Conditions

- Most of the swamp in this test region remains forested.

- Some areas near Otter Creek have been converted to agriculture.

- Swaths south of Morse Road are occupied by grassland or shrubland, drained into the creek by artificial ditches.

![Swamp Full Extent](assets/midd_lc_swampsoil.png)
- Similar patterns are borne out across the full extent around Middlebury; most swamp soils are still covered with forest. In the mountains, buildings appear likelier to occupy one-time swamp soils than agricultural use.

##### Conservation System

![Protected Status](assets/protected.png)

- A majority of swamp-soil area is not protected, as shown in this map.

- East of Otter Creek, there are larger conserved areas, some of them protected under agriculture. However, coverage is less than ideal.

![Chart](assets/benches.png)

- Compared to a 30%, 50%, or 70% conservation goal, swamp forest and shrubland swamps are falling short. The current protections for forest and shrubland/grassland on swamp soils are roughly 20-25%. Meanwhile, agricultural areas on swamp soils are relatively well protected.

##### An Alternative Model

- If we instead took habitat blocks and riparian corridors as the basis for conservation, most areas of swamp soil would fall within one or both. There are only isolated pockets falling outside of riparian corridors or outside both.

- In the test region, areas of grassland/shrubland swamp and areas converted to agriculture tend to fall within riparian zones, but outside habitat blocks. Swamp forest is almost all within both riparian corridors and habitat blocks.

- Looking here at the full Middlebury extent, we can see that swamp soils in the mountains are likelier to fall within habitat blocks or both, while swamps in the western flats are generally in riparian corridors or both.

##### Protecting and Restoring Swamp Forest

- Protection of swamp forest would become nearly universal under the alternative system.

- Most shrubland swamp is not currently protected, but falls within riparian corridors or habitat blocks, and could be targeted for restoration to a healthy forest state.
