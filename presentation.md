# Swamps
##### Background

- Swamps are inland, freshwater wetlands that are predominantly forested or covered with lower-growing shrub plants.

- In some places, past areas of swamp have been cleared and converted to crops or hayfields.

- Parts of the swamp have been degraded from healthy wet forest to a state of lower biomass and biodiversity. Possibly due to changes in hydrology introduced by ditches and berms.

- Conservation should aim to preserve existing large blocks of swamp, especially in areas with greater diversity and rarer soils, species, or natural community types. Restoration of degraded and converted swamps should also be a priority.

##### Present Conditions

- Most of the swamp in this test region remains forested.

- Some areas near Otter Creek have been converted to agriculture.

- Swaths south of Morse Road are occupied by grassland or shrubland, drained into the creek by artificial ditches.
